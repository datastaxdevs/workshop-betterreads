# üèÅ Start Hands-on

## 5. Database Initialization

#### 5.1 - Create an Astra Account

**Datastax Astra:**
Datastax Astra is a cloud-native, fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on Apache Cassandra. It provides a scalable, performant and highly available database solution without the operational overhead of managing Cassandra clusters. Astra supports both SQL and NoSQL APIs, and includes features like backup and restore, monitoring and alerting, and access control. It enables developers to focus on application development while the database infrastructure is managed by Datastax.

- `‚úÖ 5.1.a` - Access [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com) and register with `Google` or `Github` account

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-1.png?raw=true)

#### 5.2 - Create an Astra Token

- `‚úÖ 5.2.a` Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- `‚úÖ 5.2.b`Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-2.png?raw=true)

- `‚úÖ 5.2.c` - Copy your token in the clipboard. With this token we will now create what is needed for the training.

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-3.png?raw=true)

#### 5.3 - Open your Environment

**Gitpod:**
Gitpod is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to build, test and run applications directly in their web browser. It provides preconfigured dev environments for GitHub projects, so developers can start coding immediately without setting up local environment. Gitpod saves time and streamlines the development process.

> `‚úÖ 5.3.a` ‚ÜóÔ∏è _Right Click and select open as a new Tab..._
>
> [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads)

#### 5.4 - Setup Astra CLI

**Astra CLI:** The Astra CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing Apache Cassandra databases hosted on Datastax Astra. It allows developers to perform tasks like creating and managing databases, executing Cassandra queries, and managing security and access control. The Astra CLI simplifies database management and provides an alternative to the Astra web interface, enabling automation and integration with other tools and workflows.

- `‚úÖ 5.4.a` **Locate the terminal called `setup` and check that the CLI is available**

```
astra --version
```

> üñ•Ô∏è `output`

> +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
> ```

#### 5.5 - Create database

- `‚úÖ 5.5.a` **Create database `workshops` with keyspace `better_reads`**

```bash
astra db create workshops -k better_reads --if-not-exist
```

> üñ•Ô∏è `Output`
>
> ```
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' already exist. Connecting to database.
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'MAINTENANCE' waiting to be 'ACTIVE' ...
>[ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'ACTIVE' (took 7983 millis)
> ```

| Chunk         | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| `db create` | Operation executed `create` in group `db`  |
| `workshops` | Name of the database, our argument |
|`-k better_reads` | Name of the keyspace, a db can contains multiple keyspaces |
| `--if-not-exist` | Flag for itempotency creating only what if needed |

> **Note**: If the database already exist but has not been used for while the status will be `HIBERNATED`. The previous command will resume the db an create the new keyspace but it can take about a minute to execute.
>
> ```

## 8. Work with CqlSh

#### ‚úÖ 8a. Open new Terminal

It would be handy to have access to this CQLSH while doing the exercises and check the content of the database.

- Open a new terminal with the icon looking like a small table on top right hand corner of the Terminal Panel in gitpod (as shown below)

![new_terminal2](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal1.png?raw=true)

... zooming in:  

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/new-terminal2.png?raw=true)

#### ‚úÖ 8b. Enter the interactive Cqlsh *(it is a script we have created for you)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/cqlsh
```

- It should look like

```
Connected to cndb at 127.0.0.1:9042.
[cqlsh 6.8.0 | Cassandra 4.0.0.6816 | CQL spec 3.4.5 | Native protocol v4]
Use HELP for help.
token@cqlsh>
```

- List Keyspaces with 

```sql
describe keyspaces;
```

- Check that our keyspace `better_reads` is there

```
token@cqlsh> describe keyspaces;

system_virtual_schema  system_auth   data_endpoint_auth  system_traces
temporal_visibility    system_views  better_reads        ecommerce    
netflix                system        spring_petclinic    todos        
system_schema          datastax_sla  native_java         feeds_reader 

token@cqlsh> 
```

- List `better_reads` tables

```
use better_reads;
describe tables;
```

- Check that expected tables are there

```bash
token@cqlsh:better_reads> describe tables;

author_by_id  books_by_user  book_by_id  book_by_user_and_bookid
```

- Let this panel opened but for following command we will be back to the termimal
- 

[üè† Back to Table of Contents](#-table-of-content)

## 9. Load Data with DSBulk

- Check you have the dataset ready. In the `BASH` terminal **(‚ö†Ô∏è = NOT the cqlsh)**. You should see the cql file `book_by_id_0.csv`.

```
ls -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/
```

- Check how many rows. It should have more than 250k.

```
wc -l /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- Check that Datastax bulk loader is properly installed *(It has been installed for you at startup)*

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk --version
```

- Import the DataSet with the following command

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk load \
   -c csv \
   -k better_reads \
   -t book_by_id \
   -u token \
   -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} \
   -maxErrors -1 \
   -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip \
   -url /workspace/workshop-betterreads/dataset/book_by_id_0.csv
```

- The batch is running and should be able to see the throughput at ~3k records per second.

```

17,152 |      0 |  3,074 | 22.68 | 58.98 | 103.81 |    1.00
```

- The operation should take about 1 minute to complete. The file can have some errors like invalid title with special characters. IT IS NOT A PROBLEM the dataset is not perfect we will have some failed rows.

```
  total | failed | rows/s | p50ms | p99ms | p999ms | batches
250,000 |    183 |  3,684 | 21.44 | 56.10 |  66.32 |    1.00
Operation LOAD_20220214-185449-001328 completed with 183 errors in 1 minute and 7 seconds.
```

- In the same way - you can also now import `book_by_id_1.csv`.

- Count Records in the table `book_by_id`

```
/workspace/workshop-betterreads/tools/dsbulk-1.8.0/bin/dsbulk count \
   -k better_reads \
   -t book_by_id \
   -u token \
   -p ${ASTRA_DB_ADMIN_TOKEN} \
   -b /home/gitpod/.astra/scb_${ASTRA_DB_ID}_${ASTRA_DB_REGION}.zip
```

- Expected output (about 500.000k), during the live speaker will have more because he imported way more files.

## 10. Use Application as anonymous

- It would be handy to know the URL of the application

```
gp url 8080
```

- Start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Output

```

```
clear
echo $(gp url 8080)/login/oauth2/code/github
```

- Login to your github account and go to `Organizations`

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/githubapps1.png?raw=true)

- There scroll down to locate the last item of the menu `Developer Settings` *(hopefully you have not as many organizations as me)*, There pick `OAuth Apps` (we are using OAuth)
