## 2. Acknowledgements

This application has been built based on the work of [**Java Brains**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q), a famous youtuber *(500k+ subscribers)*. On his channel you can find the full [*Code with me Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxVGFBRpEFM), 16 episodes for building this application step-by-step. The link to each episode is provided at the end of this readme.

## 3. Frequently asked questions

<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</b></summary>
<hr>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine, If you do so, you will need the following
<ol>
<li><b>git</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>JDK 8+</b> installed on your local system
<li><b>Maven 3.6+</b> installed on your local system
</ol>
</p>
In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>We can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.
</details>
<p/>
<details>
<summary><b> 2Ô∏è‚É£ What other prerequisites are required?</b></summary>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>You will need an enough *real estate* on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it does not file mobiles (tablets should be OK)
<li>You will need a GitHub account eventually a google account for the Google Authentication (optional)
<li>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following
<li>As Intermediate level we expect you to know what java and Spring are. 
</ul>
</p>
</details>

# üèÅ Start Hands-on

## 5. Database Initialization

#### 5.1 - Create an Astra Account

> **Note**: **Datastax Astra** is a cloud-native, fully managed database-as-a-service (DBaaS) based on Apache Cassandra. It provides a scalable, performant and highly available database solution without the operational overhead of managing Cassandra clusters. Astra supports both SQL and NoSQL APIs, and includes features like backup and restore, monitoring and alerting, and access control. It enables developers to focus on application development while the database infrastructure is managed by Datastax.

- `‚úÖ 5.1.a` - Access [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com) and register with `Google` or `Github` account

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-1.png?raw=true)

#### 5.2 - Create an Astra Token

- `‚úÖ 5.2.a` Locate `Settings` (#1) in the menu on the left, then `Token Management` (#2) 

- `‚úÖ 5.2.b`Select the role `Organization Administrator` before clicking `[Generate Token]`

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-2.png?raw=true)

- `‚úÖ 5.2.c` - Copy your token in the clipboard. With this token we will now create what is needed for the training.

![](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/cassandra-for-data-engineers/blob/main/images/setup-astra-3.png?raw=true)

#### 5.3 - Open your Environment

> **Note**: **Gitpod** is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that allows developers to build, test and run applications directly in their web browser. It provides preconfigured dev environments for GitHub projects, so developers can start coding immediately without setting up local environment. Gitpod saves time and streamlines the development process.

> `‚úÖ 5.3.a` ‚ÜóÔ∏è _Right Click and select open as a new Tab..._
>
> [![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads)

#### 5.4 - Setup Astra CLI

> **Note**:  The **Astra CLI** is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing Apache Cassandra databases hosted on Datastax Astra. It allows developers to perform tasks like creating and managing databases, executing Cassandra queries, and managing security and access control. The Astra CLI simplifies database management and provides an alternative to the Astra web interface, enabling automation and integration with other tools and workflows.

- `‚úÖ 5.4.a` **Locate the terminal called `setup` and check that the CLI is available**

```
astra --version
```

> üñ•Ô∏è `output`
>
> ```
> $ astra --version
> 0.2.1
> ```

- `‚úÖ 5.4.b` **Trigger the setup command**

```
astra setup
```

> üñ•Ô∏è `output`
>
> ```

> +--------------------------------------+-----------------------------+---------------------+
> ```

#### 5.5 - Create database

- `‚úÖ 5.5.a` **Create database `workshops` with keyspace `better_reads`**

```bash
astra db create workshops -k better_reads --if-not-exist
```

> üñ•Ô∏è `Output`
>
> ```
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' already exist. Connecting to database.
> [ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'MAINTENANCE' waiting to be 'ACTIVE' ...
>[ INFO ] - Database 'workshops' has status 'ACTIVE' (took 7983 millis)
> ```

| Chunk         | Description     |
|--------------|-----------|
| `db create` | Operation executed `create` in group `db`  |
| `workshops` | Name of the database, our argument |
|`-k better_reads` | Name of the keyspace, a db can contains multiple keyspaces |
| `--if-not-exist` | Flag for itempotency creating only what if needed |

> **Note**: If the database already exist but has not been used for while the status will be `HIBERNATED`. The previous command will resume the db an create the new keyspace but it can take about a minute to execute.
>
> ```
> [OK]    Resuming Database 'com.dtsx.astra.sdk.db.domain.Database@406005b3' ...

## 6. Spring Applications

#### 6.1 - Configuration



```
astra db create-dotenv workshops -k better_reads
set -a
source .env
set +a
env | grep ASTRA
```


- It would be handy to know the URL of the application

```
gp url 8080
```

- Start the app

```
cd /workspace/workshop-betterreads/better-reads-webapp
mvn spring-boot:run
```

- Output

```

- Open a new terminal (yes a 3rd one again, 2 previous are busy, same icon) and enter the command.

```
gp preview $(gp url 8080)
```

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app1.png?raw=true)

- In the search item look for `Glimpses of ancient Sowams` you can search to whatever you want it will request open library ut during this workshop you only imported a subset of books, let us pick one you imported.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app2.png?raw=true)

- Select the first item, if you select the second you will hit the page book not found as this book is not in the DB.

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/app3.png?raw=true)

This is only what we can do at this point. To mark the book as read we will need to authenticate with `Google` or `Github`.

## 11. Setup Authentication

### ‚úÖ 11a. Setup Google OAuth2 (optional)

- Connect to [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com)

- Create a new project if needed, on the screens i put `BetterReadsDemoApps` and click `[CREATE]]`

![new_terminal](https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-betterreads/blob/master/img/gcp1.png?raw=true)

- Select `[ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES]` in menu

clear
echo $(gp url 8080)/login/oauth2/code/github
```

- Login to your github account and go to `Organizations`
